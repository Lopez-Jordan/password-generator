# password-generator

## Description 

For this project, I was able to utilize my newly learned javascript skills in order to prompt the user for password and output a customized password based on the user's criteria. This project took me a long time because I am still learning how javascript interacts with html elements. Try it out! It also corrects for invalid input, so try doing that aswell!
